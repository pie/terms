## Project Development Terms

_Last updated: [30/07/2025]_

These terms apply to all project-based development services provided by Pie Web Limited under the PIE Code brand. They should be read alongside our [General Terms of Business](/general), which form part of your agreement with us.

---

### 1. Definitions

- **Project**: Any scoped development work agreed under a signed contract or proposal.
- **Deposit**: A non-refundable 2.5% payment required to secure a scheduled project slot.
- **Starter Payment**: A 22.5% pre-work payment for scheduled projects, or a single 25% payment for immediate-start projects.
- **Staged Payments**: Five further payments of 15% each, billed monthly throughout and after the project.
- **Deliverables**: Any software, code, or assets to be supplied as part of the agreed project scope.

---

### 2. Booking and Scheduling

For most projects, the full upfront requirement is split into two parts:

- A **2.5% non-refundable Deposit** to secure your slot in our development schedule.
- A **22.5% Starter Payment** due before work begins.

Project timelines remain provisional until the Deposit is received and may be delayed or lost if not paid promptly.

In some cases—such as when work is due to commence immediately and scheduling permits—we may waive the Deposit and instead require a **single 25% Starter Payment** up front.

---

### 3. Project Commencement

Work will not begin until:

- We receive a signed agreement or formal approval of the proposal,
- The required upfront payment has cleared in our bank account:
  - For scheduled work: the **2.5% Deposit** and **22.5% Starter Payment**, or
  - For immediate-start work: the **25% Starter Payment**, and
- All required assets, content, access, and information have been provided by you.

Delays in payment or incomplete onboarding may result in rescheduling the project.

---

### 4. Payment Schedule

The full project cost is split as follows:

- **Scheduled projects:**
  - 2.5% Deposit (non-refundable)
  - 22.5% Starter Payment
- **Immediate-start projects:**
  - 25% Starter Payment (in place of Deposit + Starter)

Followed by:

- **5 × 15% Staged Payments** — issued monthly from the start of the project

These staged payments will continue regardless of feedback cycles and may extend beyond project completion. Unless detailed in your specific project proposal, staged payments are not tied to specific milestones.

---

### 5. Payment Obligations

By approving the project, you commit to the full payment schedule above. This applies regardless of:

- Whether you continue to use the work delivered,
- Whether you choose to pause or exit the project early, or
- Whether deliverables are under review or revision.

**All payments remain due in full. There is no option to cancel or suspend staged payments once the project has begun.**

---

### 6. Revisions and Acceptance

You’ll have 30 days after any major deliverable is issued to review and request reasonable revisions. If no feedback is received, the deliverable will be considered accepted.

Further changes after this period may be scoped and billed separately.

---

### 7. Suspension for Non-Payment

If any invoice becomes overdue:

- We may pause work and remove access to related deliverables.
- Project timelines may be revised or rescheduled.
- Continued non-payment may result in permanent suspension of services.

You remain liable for all payments due under the agreed project schedule. If necessary, we reserve the right to pursue outstanding amounts through legal action, including the use of third-party collection agencies.

We also reserve the right to charge interest on overdue invoices at the statutory rate set by the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, accruing daily from the due date until full payment is received.

You agree to cover any reasonable enforcement costs incurred in recovering unpaid amounts.

These terms should be read in conjunction with our [General Terms of Business](/general), which set out additional rights relating to late payment, legal enforcement, and limitation of liability.

---

### 8. Scope and Changes

Work is limited to the features and deliverables defined in your project proposal. Any changes will require a revised estimate and written approval before being actioned.

---

### 9. Legal Reference

All projects are governed by these terms and our [General Terms of Business](/general), which also cover intellectual property, data protection, liability limitations, and legal jurisdiction under the laws of England and Wales.
