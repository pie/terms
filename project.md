# Terms for Project Development

## What on earth are we talking about?
Your development contract is your Project Development Contract or the Project Development component of your contract with Pie Web Limited, and any further documentation directly referenced within it.

## Project commencement
Your development contract will be issued alongside an invoice for a relevant Starter Payment. Development can not begin until the Starter Payment has been cleared to Pie Web Limited.

Unless specifically stated otherwise within your development contract, development is scheduled to begin with immediate effect and any delay in the signing or payment of the Starter Payment invoice may result in delays to the start of the project or the project needing to be completely rescheduled.

## Project delivery
Throughout delivery of the Project, time shall not be of the essence, except where specifically stated in your development contract.

Should any agreed specification or design prove to be unattainable through reasonable effort, we will inform you immediately and supply in writing the closest workable solution achievable within the estimated budget. Once agreed, this solution will replace the original specification with regards to delivery for approval or acceptance testing.

We shall notify you when the Project or any agreed modular component is available for approval or acceptance testing and issue an invoice for the relevant Delivery Payments.

Unless specifically stated otherwise within your development contract, you must advise us of any errors or required revisions in that version of the Project or component within 30 days. We will use reasonable endeavours to accommodate such revisions and correct such errors.

## Project sign-off
If you do not notify us of any errors or revisions within the time-frame specified following delivery, the Project or modular component will be deemed to have been completed to a satisfactory standard and we will raise an invoice for the relevant Sign-off Payments.

After this time, any requested changes or amendments will be deemed as additional to your project development contract.

## Project scope
The scope of your development contract is restricted to that functionality described therein. We reserve the right to charge for any additional work outside of that functionality and will provide you with an additional estimate which will form part of an amended or separate development contract.

You will be required to agree the amended or separate contract before work on the amended scope can commence.

## Termination
You may request in writing that we cancel your development contract at any time.

We reserve the right without notice to cancel, reject, refuse sale to or work with a Client without reason for such rejection or refusal.

If your development contract is terminated by either party then we will be entitled to payment for work already undertaken. The invoice for such work must be paid by within 30 days of receipt.
