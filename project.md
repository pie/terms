# Terms for Project Development

## What on earth are we talking about?
If we are undertaking project development for you, then these terms will form part of our contract.

## Project commencement
Your development contract will be issued alongside an invoice for a relevant Starter Payment. Development can not begin until the Starter Payment has been cleared to Pie Web Limited and all the required assets, information and materials have been made available to us.

Unless specifically stated otherwise within your development contract, development is scheduled to begin with immediate effect. Any delay in the signing or payment of the Starter Payment invoice, or delay in the supply of any required designs, information or materials may result in delays to the project or the project needing to be completely rescheduled.

## Project delivery
Throughout delivery of the Project, time shall not be of the essence, except where specifically stated in your development contract.

Should any agreed specification or design prove to be unattainable through reasonable effort, we will inform you immediately and supply in writing the closest workable solution achievable within the estimated budget. Once agreed, this solution will replace the original specification with regards to delivery for approval or acceptance testing.

We shall notify you when the Project or any agreed modular component is available for approval or acceptance testing and issue an invoice for the relevant Delivery Payments.

Unless specifically stated otherwise within your development contract, you must advise us of any errors or required revisions in that version of the Project or component within 30 days. We will use reasonable endeavours to accommodate such revisions and correct such errors.

## Project sign-off
If you do not notify us of any errors or revisions within the time-frame specified following delivery, the Project or modular component will be deemed to have been completed to a satisfactory standard and we will raise an invoice for the relevant Sign-off Payments.

After this time, any requested changes or amendments will be deemed as additional to your project development contract.

## Project scope
The scope of your development contract is restricted to that functionality described therein. We reserve the right to charge for any additional work outside of that functionality and will provide you with an additional estimate which will form part of an amended or separate development contract.

You will be required to agree the amended or separate contract before work on the amended scope can commence.

## Outstanding payments
If payment is not received within the due date of any invoice, we reserve the right to refuse to undertake any further work for you until your account is back in good standing.

We also reserve the right to remove any work done from any computer systems and the internet or remove public access to those systems if invoice payments remain outstanding. Such an action does not relieve yout of your obligation to pay the due amount. You also agree to be liable for any reasonable legal expenses and third party collection agency fees in the enforcement of this condition.
