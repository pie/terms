# General Terms of Business

## Before we start working

Any prices that we provide in an estimate or a contract will be valid for 30 days. If you get back to us after this time, we might need to review the pricing.

## If you need to back out

You may request that we terminate any contract at any time.

We will always accept a request for termination if work has not yet begun, no services have been delivered and we have incurred no costs relating to any work or services upon which we've agreed.

If work or service delivery has already begun or any costs have been incurred then you agree to pay us for that work, those services or those costs. You will not be entitled to refunds of any payments already made.

## Outstanding payments

If payment is not received within 30 days of the due date of any invoice, we reserve the right to:
 
* Refuse to undertake any further work for you until your account is back in good standing. 
* Remove public access to any related hosting environment until your account is brought back into good standing.
* Remove any work done from any computer systems and the internet or remove public access to those systems until your account is brought back into good standing.
* Apply a late payment fee of 8% interest per month, accruing daily until your account is brought back into good standing.
* Engage a third party collection agency with subsequent charges added to your outstanding balance.
* Hold you liable for any reaasonable legal expenses incurred in the enforcement of this condition.

## A bit about copyright

We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we reserve the right to display and link to any work as part of our portfolio and to write about the projects on websites, in magazine articles and in books about web design / development.

## A bit of legal stuff

We will always endeavor to meet any deadlines upon which we agree and we are specialists in what we do, but we are human so we can't guarantee that our work will always be error-free and that we won't come up against unforeseen problems. As such, we can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of a missed deadline, the operation of or inability to operate a web site or any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

All services we provide to you are governed by these terms and conditions. Any changes to these terms must be agreed by both parties in writing.

If we don't happen to enforce any of these terms and conditions at any time or for any period, that does not mean that they do not apply and does not in any way exonerate you or affect your liability. It also does not waive our right to enforce these conditions at any time afterwards.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
