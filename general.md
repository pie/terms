# General Terms of Business

## Before we start working

Any prices that we provide in an estimate or a contract will be valid for 30 days. If you get back to us after this time, we might need to review the pricing.

## If you need to back out

You may request that we terminate any contract at any time.

We will always accept a request for termination if work has not yet begun, no services have been delivered and we have incurred no costs relating to any work or services upon which we've agreed.

If work or service delivery has already begun or any costs have been incurred then you agree to pay us for that work, those services or those costs. You will not be entitled to refunds of any payments already made.

## What do both parties agree to?

As our client, you agree that:

* The compliance with any laws and legal requirements of any work that we do for you is wholly your responsibility.
* You will not resell or distribute our work in any form unless we specifically tell you that it's OK to do so.
* You will keep any passwords or access details we share with you confidential at all times.





## A bit about copyright

You guarantee that you own any elements of text, graphics, photos, designs, trademarks, or other artwork / resources that you provide, or that you have permission to use them.

We guarantee to you that any third party code or code library will be used within the terms of its own licence.

On full payment, we will release any HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP code that we create under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3. This is an open software license that will not bind you to any charges going forward. For more information, please visit

We love to show off our work and share what we have learned with other people, so we reserve the right to display and link to any work as part of our portfolio and to write about the projects on web sites, in magazine articles and in books about web design / development.

## A bit of legal stuff

We are specialists in what we do, but we are human os we can't guarantee that our work will always be error-free. We can't be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages arising out of a missed deadline, the operation of or inability to operate a web site or any other web pages, even if you have advised us of the possibilities of such damages.

All services we provide to you are governed by these terms and conditions. If there is any conflict between them and any other agreement we make, then these terms and conditions will take precedence.

If we don't happen to enforce any of these terms and conditions at any time or for any period, that does not mean that they do not apply and does not in any way exonerate you or affect your liability. It also does not waive our right to enforce these conditions at any time afterwards.

If any provision of this agreement shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this agreement and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.
