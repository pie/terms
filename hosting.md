# Terms for Hosting Contracts

## What on earth are we talking about?
Your hosting contract is your Ongoing Web Hosting Contract or the Web Hosting Support component of your contract with Pie Web Limited, and any further documentation directly referenced within it.

## WPMUDev as a provider
Our website hosting is provided by WPMUDev and we are able to pass on the terms afforded by their 99.9% uptime guarantee at https://wpmudev.com/hosting/

## Support provision
Our Just Hosting website hosting is offered without any support package for development, and only covers issues related directly to the hosting platform or core WordPress software. In the absence of a separate Ongoing Support Contract or Ongoing Support component within your hosting contract we encourage you to make use of our ad-hoc support channel available at https://support.pie.co.de

## Outstanding payments
If payment is not received within the due date of any invoice, we reserve the right to remove public access to the related hosting environment until such time as your account is brought back into good standing.

Removal of public access does not remove your hosting package, does not relieve you of your obligation to pay any due amount, nor does it prevent subsequent billing cycles from being triggered.

## Term and Termination
Your hosting contract has no minimum term and may be cancelled at any time by yourself. If you decide that you wish to terminate your contract, all you need to do is let us know and we will remove your web hosting at the end of your current billing cycle. No refund or credit will be issued for termination mid-cycle.
