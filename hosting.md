# Hosting Terms

_Last updated: [30/07/2025]_
> These terms apply to all hosting services provided by PIE Code, a trading name of Pie Web Limited (Company No. 07995302). They should be read in conjunction with our [General Terms of Business](./general.md), which apply to all services unless explicitly overridden here.

---

## 1. Hosting Overview

PIE Code offers hosting services under two primary plans:

- **Just Hosting** – infrastructure-only WordPress hosting
- **White Glove Hosting** – fully managed hosting with support, optimisation, and monitoring

In limited cases, we also offer infrastructure-only hosting via Cloudways. See Section 4 for details.

### 1.1 Just Hosting

Just Hosting includes:

- Infrastructure provisioned through WPMU Dev
- Access to curated premium plugins and platform features
- Optional bolt-ons available for added flexibility at an additional charge

This plan includes no active management or support. If you encounter issues, you are expected to resolve them directly or via [WPMU Dev support](https://wpmudev.com/hub2/support/). PIE Code’s role is limited to initial provisioning.

### 1.2 White Glove Hosting

White Glove Hosting includes everything in Just Hosting, along with:

- Managed WordPress updates, security checks, and monitoring
- Best-effort performance and SEO improvements
- Support desk access for site assistance (within scope)
- Out-of-hours recovery via [WPMU Dev Proactive Monitoring](https://wpmudev.com/docs/hub-2-0/expert-services/#proactive-monitoring)

#### Scope of Service

All features and inclusions are defined in the [White Glove Hosting product description](https://pie.co.de/services/white-glove-hosting/) and may be updated from time to time.

- **Development support is excluded.** If we need to open a code editor, that work will likely fall under a separate [WordPress Development Strongarm](./support.md) contract.
- We are happy to assist with plugin configuration, content updates, and general admin tasks—within reasonable limits. See Fair Use below.

#### 1.2.1 Fair Use Policy

White Glove Hosting offers flexible, on-demand help, but to ensure service quality for all clients:

- We may defer or decline tasks that exceed a reasonable level of support
- "Reasonable" is defined at our discretion based on usage patterns and availability
- Clients with ongoing support needs may be directed to a retained support agreement

This policy is designed to accommodate occasional bursts of activity without overcommitting our team. We aim to be generous—but not unlimited.

## 2. Service Levels and Limits

- Platform limits such as storage, bandwidth, or backup retention are defined by your plan and may be subject to change
- You’ll be notified if you exceed any such limits, and we may recommend bolt-ons to support your growth
- White Glove Hosting includes proactive incident response, but does not carry an SLA unless explicitly agreed
- For time-based support guarantees or dedicated capacity, see our [Support Terms](./support.md)

## 3. Support Scope and Escalation

Support varies by plan:

| Plan             | Ongoing Support | Issue Monitoring | Plugin/Theme Help | Development |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Just Hosting     | ❌ None           | ❌ None            | ❌ None            | ❌ Not included |
| White Glove      | ✅ In-scope only  | ✅ Proactive (via WPMU Dev) | ✅ Basic config     | ❌ Excluded      |

We will advise you if a support request exceeds the scope of White Glove Hosting and may recommend a transition to an ad-hoc or retained support plan.

## 4. Other Hosting Infrastructure

If we provision your hosting on a third-party platform (e.g. Cloudways):

- We provide infrastructure only
- You are responsible for platform costs and configuration
- The service is subject to the third-party provider’s own terms
- PIE Code does not monitor or manage the environment unless separately agreed

We'll confirm your hosting environment at onboarding or renewal.

## 5. Billing, Suspension, and Termination

- Hosting is billed in advance, monthly or annually
- Cancellations may be made at any time, but no partial refunds are offered
- If payment is missed, we may suspend public access to your site until resolved
- Suspension does not void your obligation to pay the full amount due

For billing, interest on late payments, and legal enforcement, refer to our [General Terms of Business](./general.md).
