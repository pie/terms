# Terms for Hosting Contracts

## What on earth are we talking about?
Your hosting contract is your Ongoing Web Hosting Contract or the Web Hosting Support component of your contract with Pie Web Limited, and any further documentation directly referenced within it.

## WP Engine as a provider
Our website hosting is provided by WP Engine and we are able to pass on the terms afforded by their Service Level Agreement (SLA) at https://wpengine.com/legal/sla/

## Overages
Each install has a limit of 10GB storage, 50GB monthly bandwidth and 25,000 monthly unique visitors. Overages are charged at the rate defined in your hosting contract, but if it comes to the point where this rule needs to apply we will happily work with you to help manage the storage and visitor levels to help minimise these costs as much as possible.

## Support provision
Our website hosting is offered without any support package. In the absence of a separate Ongoing Support Contract or Ongoing Support component within your hosting contract we encourage you to make use of the support provided directly by WP Engine via https://my.wpengine.com including 24/7 live chat, documentation and their own dedicated support desk.

## Outstanding payments
If payment is not received within the due date of any invoice, we reserve the right to remove public access to the related hosting environment until such time as your account is brought back into good standing.

Removal of public access does not remove your hosting package, does not relieve you of your obligation to pay any due amount, nor does it prevent subsequent billing cycles from being triggered.

## Term and Termination
Your hosting contract has no minimum term and may be cancelled at any time by yourself. If you decide that you wish to terminate your contract, all you need to do is let us know and we will remove your web hosting at the end of your current billing cycle. No refund or credit will be issued for termination mid-cycle.
